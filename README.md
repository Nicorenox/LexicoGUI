# Lexicographic Analyzer with GUI in Python

This project is a lexicographic analyzer developed in Python that uses regular expressions to identify and display Spanish words and emoticons present in a text string. The program also has a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the emoticons in high definition after processing the string.

## Project Features

- Analyzes a text string for Spanish words and emoticons according to a predefined BNF grammar.
- Utilizes a provided Spanish dictionary to verify whether a word belongs to the Spanish language.
- Displays the identified emoticons in the graphical user interface, replacing the corresponding characters from the original string.
- Shows the number of identified Spanish words and emoticons.
